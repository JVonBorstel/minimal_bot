# Enhanced Agent Features

The bot now includes optional enhanced agent capabilities that provide intelligent planning and detailed progress feedback for complex requests.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Planning
- Automatically detects complex requests that benefit from step-by-step planning
- Creates detailed execution plans with dependency management
- Provides clear expectations: "I'll do X, Y, Z in approximately N seconds"

### ⚡ Real-time Progress Tracking
- Step-by-step status updates with progress bars
- Live feedback: "Step 2/4: Analyzing Jira tickets... [▓▓▓░░░░░░░] 30%"
- Execution time tracking and estimates

### 🔧 Smart Error Recovery
- Intelligent error handling with recovery suggestions
- Fallback strategies: "Step failed, trying alternative approach..."
- Graceful degradation to standard mode if enhanced features fail

### 📝 Context Awareness
- Conversation context memory across interactions
- Smart clarification requests for ambiguous queries
- Adaptive response templates based on user preferences

## 🚀 How to Enable

### Method 1: Environment Variable
```bash
# Linux/Mac
export ENABLE_ENHANCED_AGENT=true

# Windows PowerShell
$env:ENABLE_ENHANCED_AGENT='true'

# Windows Command Prompt
set ENABLE_ENHANCED_AGENT=true
```

### Method 2: Programmatically
```python
import os
os.environ['ENABLE_ENHANCED_AGENT'] = 'true'
```

## 🎯 When Enhanced Mode Activates

Enhanced planning automatically activates for queries containing:

### Complexity Indicators
- "step by step"
- "detailed analysis" 
- "comprehensive"
- "full analysis"
- "analyze my"
- "create report"
- "compare multiple"
- "workflow"

### Planning Keywords
- "plan my"
- "strategy for"
- "approach to"
- "methodology"

### Multi-tool Patterns
- "jira and github"
- "tickets and repos"
- "multiple tools"

## 📊 Example Usage

### Simple Query (Standard Mode)
```
User: "Show me my Jira tickets"
Bot: [Standard processing - immediate response]
```

### Complex Query (Enhanced Mode)
```
User: "Please analyze my Jira tickets step by step and create a comprehensive report"

Bot: 🧠 Enhanced Mode - Analyzing complex request with intelligent planning...

🎯 Execution Plan
I'll complete this in 3 steps (estimated 8.0 seconds):
1. Authenticate with Jira API
2. Retrieve your Jira tickets  
3. Analyze ticket status and priorities

⚡ Step 1/3: Authenticating with Jira API
[▓▓▓░░░░░░░] 30%

✅ Completed: Authentication successful (2.1s)

⚡ Step 2/3: Retrieving your Jira tickets
[▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░] 60%

✅ Completed: Retrieved 12 tickets (3.2s)

⚡ Step 3/3: Analyzing ticket status and priorities
[▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓] 100%

✅ Completed: Analysis complete (1.8s)

🎯 Mission Accomplished! Completed 3/3 steps in 7.1s

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Fully backward compatible** - original functionality remains unchanged by default
- **No parallel systems** - enhanced features integrate cleanly into existing agent loop
- **Lazy loading** - enhanced components only loaded when needed
- **Graceful fallback** - automatically falls back to standard mode if enhanced features fail

### Core Components
1. **EnhancedAgentController** - Intelligent multi-step planning and execution
2. **IntelligentResponseComposer** - Context-aware response composition with progress tracking
3. **Enhanced Agent Loop Integration** - Clean integration into existing `agent_loop.py`

### Files Modified
- `core_logic/agent_loop.py` - Added optional enhanced mode check and processing
- No existing functionality changed - completely additive

### Files Added
- `core_logic/enhanced_agent_controller.py` - Intelligent planning controller
- `core_logic/intelligent_response_composer.py` - Smart response composition

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Basic Tests
```bash
python tests/test_simple_enhanced_integration.py
```

### Run Comprehensive Integration Tests
```bash
python tests/test_agent_loop_integration.py
```

### Run Demo
```bash
python scripts/enhanced_agent_demo.py
```

## 🛡️ Safety & Reliability

- **Zero breaking changes** - All existing functionality preserved
- **Automatic fallback** - Falls back to standard mode on any error
- **Environment controlled** - Disabled by default, opt-in via environment variable
- **Comprehensive testing** - Full test coverage for both modes
- **Clean error handling** - Intelligent error recovery with user-friendly messages

## 🎛️ Configuration

The enhanced mode is controlled by a single environment variable:

- `ENABLE_ENHANCED_AGENT=true` - Enable enhanced mode
- `ENABLE_ENHANCED_AGENT=false` or unset - Use standard mode (default)

No other configuration required - the system automatically:
- Detects complexity of user requests
- Loads enhanced components when needed
- Provides appropriate level of feedback
- Falls back gracefully on any issues

## 💡 Benefits

### For Users
