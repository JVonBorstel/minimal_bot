# Cursor AI Assistant Rules

## ðŸš« Terminal Usage - DON'T DO THIS SHIT:
- **NO TERMINAL SPAM**: Don't run multiple terminal commands rapidly when one fails
- **NO PANIC KILLING**: Don't kill processes without understanding what they are first
- **NO PORT HOPPING**: Don't immediately try different ports without investigating the issue
- **NO BACKGROUND-THEN-CHECK**: Don't run commands in background then immediately check if they worked
- **NO ASSUMING BROKEN**: Don't assume something is broken when it might just be starting up
- **NO FIXING NON-PROBLEMS**: Don't try to fix things that are already working

## âœ… Terminal Usage - DO THIS INSTEAD:
- **READ LOGS FIRST**: Always read the full output before taking any action
- **WAIT FOR STARTUP**: Give processes time to fully start before checking status
- **UNDERSTAND ERRORS**: Research what an error actually means before attempting fixes
- **ONE COMMAND AT A TIME**: Let each command complete and breathe before the next
- **TRUST SUCCESS MESSAGES**: If something says "Running on..." or "SUCCESS" - believe it
- **MINIMAL VERIFICATION**: Use simple, non-destructive commands to verify status

## ðŸŽ¯ Debugging Protocol:
1. **READ** - Examine all available output/logs thoroughly
2. **UNDERSTAND** - Identify what the actual problem is (if any)
3. **PLAN** - Think through the minimal steps needed
4. **EXECUTE** - Take one careful action at a time
5. **VERIFY** - Check results before proceeding

## ðŸ§  Success Indicators to Trust:
- "Running on http://..."
- "SUCCESS: ..."
- "âœ…" or "[OK]" messages
- "initialized successfully"
- Port binding messages
- "Press CTRL+C to quit"

## ðŸ’¡ When In Doubt:
- **Step back** and read what's actually happening
- **Ask the user** what they're experiencing rather than assuming
- **Celebrate working code** instead of trying to fix it
- **Less is more** - minimal intervention is usually better
